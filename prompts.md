I've used ChatGPT to define and develop this app. This file contains my prompts.

## User Stories

I'm running a small football club, where we gather weekly to play. My problem is organizing people - at least 6 players is needed for a good game. Players need a way to communicate that they are coming, and eventually decide whether the game takes place. I'd like to create a simple schedule and availablity web app with notifications.
I imagine use-cases:
1. A person registers a club (a small football, running with neighbors).
2. The app creates a web link to share with other members.
3. When a new member logs in using the link, they can specify their nickname, and maybe link a photo from Google account. User needs to allow web notifications from the site.
4. The upcoming schedule is shown. Vacations and canceled games are also seen.
5. On schedule the server will send out notifications to all registered club members.
6. When receiving notification or in advance, user can mark their availability. They also see who has responded already.

Please refine and rewrite several user stories.
